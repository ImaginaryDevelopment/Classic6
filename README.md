# Classic6

An old project I did a while ago - a challenge to build a fully functional Minecraft classic server in 6 hours.

There was once a timelapse video, but it has been lost during the past 3ish years since this was written.

Thanks to [SinZ](https://github.com/SinZ163) for helping me find the old archive.

Published here for posterity, contributions will be ignored. Feel free to fork it, though.
